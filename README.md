## Portfolio Spotlight

### Introduction

Hello! You've landed on the portfolio page for Sherry Kosmicki. I just graduated from Bellevue University with my Masters degree in Data Science. I've worked for a corporate hospital system for over 25 years. Working in Finance has given me a wide range of experience using data and building time-saving solutions. During the COVID lockdown I made the conscious decision to go back to school and learn something new. I learned a new coding language and have a greater understanding of statistics concepts. I've included links to some of the various projects I completed throughout my masters program.

### Graduation Rates Project

This project uses national education statistics and attempts to predict which type of academic institution to choose based on higher graduation rates. Analysis was also done to determine if there is a correlation between those students that receive aid vs those that do not receive aid and the graduation rates.

### Airline Crash Analysis

This project was a deep dive in the various visualizations you can create to display data. I built a dashboard, an executive summary, blog post, info graphic and final presentation. While developing these different visualization products I had to consider format, color, ethics and content relative to the audience receiving the information.
